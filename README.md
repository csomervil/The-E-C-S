# The E-Commerce-System

# Introduction

The ECS is used to store, delete, update, and retrieve information from a database. It is a back-end project made using Node.js, and the MySQL database. Installations are used such as dotnev to avoid leaking private information. When using the application one must create a .env file and fill in the corresponding information found in the connection.js file. 

# Usage:

The demo video shows how to run the program. One must first run the schema commands in a MySQL terminal and then use the following node commands: npm run seed -> node server.
